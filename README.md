-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* For this project I built an app for a company needing a way for employees to share contact information.
* I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees".
* I then used that data to build a prototype for the employee directory.
* I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their information.
* I programed a modal window with more detailed information upon clicking on the employee's image or name.
